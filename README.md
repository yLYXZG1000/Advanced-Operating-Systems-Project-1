Advanced Operating Systems Project 1

1 Project Description
This project consists of three parts.

1.1 Part 1
Implement a distributed system consisting of n nodes, numbered 0 to n − 1, arranged in a certain topology. The topology and information about other parameters will be provided in a configuration file. A process can exchange messages only with processes that are its neighbors in the given topology.
All channels in the system are bidirectional, reliable and satisfy the first-in-first-out (FIFO) property. You can implement a channel using a reliable socket connection via TCP or SCTP (preferred). For each channel, the socket connection should be created at the beginning of the program and should stay intact until the end of the program. All messages between neighboring nodes are exchanged over these connections.

1.2 Part 2
Implement a synchronizer to simulate a synchronous distributed system as follows. All nodes execute a sequence of rounds. In each round, a node sends one message to each of its neighbors,
then waits to receive one message from each of its neighbors sent in that round and then advances to the next round. Observe that any message received by a node from a “future” round should be buffered until the node has moved to that round.

1.3 Part 3
Design and implement a distributed algorthm that uses the synchronizer built in Part 2 to allow each node in the system to compute its eccentricity. The eccentricity of a node is defined as the maximum distance between a node to all other nodes in the topology. Your algorithm can assume that, initially, all nodes know n in addition to their 1-hop neighbors.

2 Submission Information
All the submission will be through eLearning. Submit all the source files necessary to compile the program and run it. Also, submit a README file that contains instructions to compile and run your program. You should also include launcher.sh and cleanup.sh scripts which run your program on the machines as configured and cleanup your processes.

3 Configuration Format
Your program should run using a configuration file in the following format:
The configuration file will be a plain-text formatted file no more than 100kB in size. Only lines which begin with an unsigned integer are considered to be valid. Lines which are not valid should be ignored. The configuration file will contain 2n + 1 valid lines. The first valid line of the configuration file contains one token that denotes the number of nodes in the system. After the first valid line, the next n lines consist of three tokens. The first token is the node ID. The second token is the host-name of the machine on which the node runs. The third token is the port on which the node listens for incoming connections. After the first n + 1 valid lines, the next n lines consist of a space delimited list of at most n − 1 tokens. The kth valid line after the first line is a space delimited list of node IDs which are the neighbor of node k. Your parser should be written so as to be robust concerning leading and trailing white space or extra lines at the beginning or end of file, as well as interleaved with valid lines. The # character will denote a comment. On any
valid line, any characters after a # character should be ignored.
You are responsible for ensuring that your program runs correctly when given a valid configu-
ration file. Make no additional assumptions concerning the configuration format.

4 Output Format
If the configuration file is named <config_name>.dat and is configured to use n nodes, then your program should output n output files, named in according to the following format: <config_name>-<node_id>.out, where node_id ∈ {0, ..., n − 1}.
The output file for process j should be named <config_name>-j.dat and should contain the following: its k-hop neighborhood for k = 0, 1, . . . , n − 1 followed by its eccentricity (all on separate lines). An example file is described below.
